# WGBIOP

WGBIOP provides a bridge between data collectors and end users.

The Working Group on Biological Parameters (WGBIOP) is a newly formed expert group which took over the responsibilities of PGCCDBS (Planning Group on Commercial Catches, Discards and Biological Sampling) on coordination of a practical implementation of quality assured and statistically sound development of methods, standards and guidelines for the provision of accurate biological parameters for stock assessment purposes. However, the focus of such a group is not only on technical aspects of data collection and quality assurance but also on accuracy in life history parameter estimations to support stock assessment. WGBIOP will review stock specific life history parameters and monitor potential changes in biological processes, such as growth rate, onset of maturity, maturity and fecundity at size/age, and related causal factors.

The WGBIOP will be dedicated to provide a rapid and efficient handling of the consequent increasing demands for new biological parameters and new number of species included in EC-ICES Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).

WGBIOP is an expert group devoted to all stages of the provision of biological parameters (methodological improvements, implementation, quality assurance, statistical analysis) at a national, regional and stock level. It provides a bridge between the data collectors and end users that has often been lacking. Considering the broadened tasks, the group strongly depends on participation and experts from different disciplines (e.g. statisticians/biologists/ stock assessors, survey expert, National coordinators of age-and maturity-staging) will be invited in relation to the specific ToRs.
